# neko.bot Hooks
Hooks are integration layers between [neko.bot libraries](/libraries), foreign crates like [fluent](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs) and [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), and even just ordinary sql schemas, with the [neko.bot framework](/framework), so that they can be easily shared and used across [neko.bot modules](/modules)
